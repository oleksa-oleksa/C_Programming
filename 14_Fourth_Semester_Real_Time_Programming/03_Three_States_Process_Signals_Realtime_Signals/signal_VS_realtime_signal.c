/* Whats the difference between RT signals and standard signals?
More than one RT signal can be queued for the process if it has the signal blocked while someone sends it. In standard signals only one of a given type is queued, the rest is ignored.
Order of delivery of RT signal is guaranteed to be the same as the sending order.
PID and UID of sending process is written to si_pid and si_uid fields of siginfo_t.*/
